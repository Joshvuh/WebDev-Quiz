# WebDev Quiz

## Description

Small WebDev quiz created to practice JavaScript, mostly practicing local storage and the ability to add and remove elements using JS. Doesn't 100% work in FireFox, for some reason the high scores pull from local storage in Chrome but not FireFox.

Take the quiz by clicking the "Start Game" button.
